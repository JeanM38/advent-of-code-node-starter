## üõ†Ô∏è Generate a new day

Each day, a new algorithm to create, a template is here to help you, just run this command to create a new folder and retrieve advent of code data

```shell
$ npm exec new-day {YEAR} {DAY}
```

At this point, you got three files in a new folder (for example `2023/1`) :

<h5 a><strong><code>challenge.js</code></strong></h5>
Insert your algorithm into this method, don't hesitate to create other methods and class properties to resolve the problem and keep your code clean

<h5 a><strong><code>input.txt</code></strong></h5>
Each challenge comes with its input, the Challenge class of the <code>challenge.js</code> file will read it input inside of this file.

<h5 a><strong><code>README.md</code></strong></h5>
You can retrieve the challenge instructions here
